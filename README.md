### Built with

### What I learned
Since I was unfamiliar with working with svg files, I took the time to research this file format and learned about the various ways svg artwork is created and how it can be used within HTML files and styled with CSS. I also did a little bit of research into various ways on how to get the view icon to appear when the main image was rolled over and decided to go with Grid to accomplish this.
